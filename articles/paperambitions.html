        <h1>2D minecraft, for the Web</h1>
        <p>
            Minecraft recently came out with Minecraft 1.20: the Tales & Trails
            update, with a focus on the player's story and expression, and all
            of this jogged up my annual Minecraft fever, and I played the very
            first snapshots for a while, before going down to look at what made
            Minecraft mechanics work, and this turned into a nice foray into
            html5 game development

        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <p>
            While I originally just wanted to replicate Minecraft, I saw it as
            more of an opportunity to go building my own sandbox game. In terms
            of original concept art, my best was just basing it off the Minecon
            visuals and turning them into a game, I did my best with my artistic
            skills
        </p>
        <h2>A self-made map versus procedural generation</h2>
        <p>
            When I was making the world, I had two options: procedural
            generation like Minecraft, or a self-made map, like ARK. When I
            looked at procedural generation in phaser, I saw one tutorial on a
            flat face-down procedural, and nothing on the vertical top-down
            world I was looking for. So I chose to make my map in Tiled, and
            exported it to phaser. The programming and rendering of it was
            really simple,
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            this.map = this.make.tilemap({ key: "map" });
            this.tiles = this.map.addTilesetImage("Tileset", "Tileset");
            this.backgroundLayer = this.map.createLayer("Background", this.tiles, 0, 0);
            this.worldLayer = this.map.createLayer("Block", this.tiles, 0, 0);
            this.worldLayer.setCollisionByProperty({ collides: true });
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Bring the JSON tiled export and tileset into your assets, preload
            them into Phaser, then declare the map and tileset. After that, just
            create each layer and enable the collisions, which you can do by
            setting the custom property in Tiled.
        </p>
        <h2>The Main Character</h2>
        <p>
            The main character is just a simple phaser platformer character,
            with arrow key/space bar based movement, with a physics collider. He
            has spritesheet based animations
        </p>
        <h2>Mobs</h2>
        <p>
            The only mob in the game is chickens, only interactable through
            physics based means, no hitting/damage. They have a simple random
            movement AI.
        </p>
        <h2>Placing/removing blocks</h2>
        <p>The placing and removing blocks system follows simple steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check whether trying to place or remove block</li>
            <li>Check tile id and whether tile is inbounds</li>
            <li>Update inventory, and Update Weight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tile ID is just the ID of the in its tileset</p>
        <h2>The Inventory and UI</h2>
        <p>
            The inventory is an array, changed by the placing and removing block
            functions, which is taken and rendered in the HTML UI. All the UI is
            just a Layer of html on top of the phaser game, with query selectors
            on all elements.
        </p>
        <h2>Fall damage</h2>
        <p>
            This was hard to calculate, as I couldn't use air time or distance
            travelled in air, as the character speeds up while falling, like
            realistic physics, so the best method I got was the velocity of the
            character, with a higher velocity resulting in higher fall damage.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            While I've gone as far as I will with this game, Its open source,
            and I encourage others to take the code and make better sandbox
            games.
